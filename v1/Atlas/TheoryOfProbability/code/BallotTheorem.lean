/-- The combinatorial *ballot count* `ballotCount a b`: the number of
ways to order `a` votes for candidate A and `b` votes for candidate B so that A
strictly leads B throughout the counting. It is defined by the natural
recurrence at the boundary between the +1 and -1 partial sums: zero when
`a = 0`, one when `b = 0` (any ordering of all-A votes is valid), and
`ballotCount a (b+1) + ballotCount (a+1) b` when `a > b`. -/

/-- **Ballot Theorem (integer form).** If candidate A receives `a` votes and
candidate B receives `b < a` votes, then the number of vote orderings in which
A is strictly ahead throughout the count, times the total number of votes,
equals `(a - b)` times the number of orderings of the votes:
`ballotCount a b * (a + b) = (a - b) * C(a + b, a)`. This is the combinatorial
content of the classical Bertrand ballot theorem (Durrett, Lecture 23). -/
