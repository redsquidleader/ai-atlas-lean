/-- **Prokhorov's theorem (sequential form on ℝ).** A sequence of probability measures `μ n` on
`ℝ` is tight if and only if every subsequence has a further subsequence that converges weakly to
some probability measure `ν`. This is the tightness ↔ relative compactness equivalence for
probability measures on `ℝ`. -/
