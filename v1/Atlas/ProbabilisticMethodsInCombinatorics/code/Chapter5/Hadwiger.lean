/-- `H.IsMinor G` asserts that `H` is a minor of `G`: there is a family of pairwise
disjoint, nonempty, connected vertex subsets (branch sets) $\{f(w)\}_{w \in W}$ of `G`
such that whenever $w_1$ and $w_2$ are adjacent in `H`, there is an edge in `G` between
the branch sets $f(w_1)$ and $f(w_2)$. -/

/-- **Hadwiger's conjecture** (Conjecture 5.3.1, Hadwiger 1936). For every $t \geq 1$,
any graph $G$ that does not contain $K_{t+1}$ as a minor is $t$-colorable. -/
