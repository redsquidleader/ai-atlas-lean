`u · v` of two tempered distributions is well-defined: for every point `p` of
the closed unit ball and every direction `ω` on the sphere, if `(p, ω)` lies
in the scattering wavefront set of `u`, then the antipodal direction
`(p, -ω)` must not lie in the scattering wavefront set of `v`. -/

lie in the scattering wavefront set of `v`. This is the Fourier-dual of
