## About ATLAS

ATLAS translates mathematical statements and proofs from undergraduate and
graduate textbooks into Lean. Its goal is to provide reusable formal building
blocks for human- and machine-assisted theorem proving across analysis,
algebra, geometry, topology, probability, statistics, and theoretical
computer science.

The project was generated with
[AutoformBot](https://github.com/facebookresearch/autoform-bot), an
autoformalization pipeline for developing Lean libraries at scale.

## Explore v1

The complete first release—including its Lean sources, evaluation reports,
build configuration, documentation, and companion paper—is available under
[`v1/`](v1/README.md).

```bash
cd v1
lake build
```
